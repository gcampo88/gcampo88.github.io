Welcome to my first GH Pages project! This is a simple Asteroids game made using Canvas (and circles for all shapes, for simplicity). This was done as an exercise in prototypal inheritance. It was played ad nauseum as an exercise in Asteroids is awesome. 

Use arrow keys to move and space bar to fire. Have fun!
